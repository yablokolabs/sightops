"""Build the demo video's subtitles from the narration's own word timing.

The timings come from the provider's per-character alignment, so a subtitle appears
exactly when the words are spoken instead of being estimated from the length of the
text. Video time and audio time are the same timeline here: the render places each
segment at the running total of the previous segments' durations, which is how the
track was built.

Writes both formats, because the SRT is what most players want and the WebVTT is what
an HTML `<track>` wants:

    python3 scripts/build_subtitles.py

Reads videos/sightops-demo/audio/originals/voiceovers/v1/{provider_script.md,timing.json}
and writes ../subtitles/sightops-demo.{srt,vtt}.
