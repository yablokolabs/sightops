"""Rebuild audio track v1 of the SightOps demo video and sync the scene timing to it.

Run this after `videos/sightops-demo/audio/originals/voiceovers/v1/generate.sh`. It:

1. normalises the voiceover to -16 LUFS and writes `audio/tracks/v1/track.mp3`;
2. computes, from the word timestamps in `timing.json`, when each scene starts and when
   each reveal inside a scene happens;
3. writes those times to `audio/tracks/v1/track.ts` and to the `advances` of each
   segment (videowright reads the track; the segment values are the fallback).

The times are segment-relative seconds and multiples of one frame, so that rounding in
the render cannot add up to audio drift. Needs ffmpeg and ffprobe.

The check against `provider_script.md` is a staleness guard: it rejects a `timing.json`
that was generated from a different script, because silently timing the wrong words
would put every reveal in the wrong place.
